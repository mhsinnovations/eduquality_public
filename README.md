Eduquality.
Eduquality is an iOS and Android mobile application designed to promote equitable access to educational tech resources for all. This app is currently being implemented at events hosted by The TechShare Project, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to spreading access to technology across the globe. At TechShare events, we bring donated tech equipment to under-resourced communities. We’re currently working with Newark’s Thirteenth Avenue School and New York City’s Robin Hood Foundation to teach students how to code using Raspberry Pis, single-board computers that are perfect for beginner programmers. At TechShare, we’re committed to creating sustainable change. That’s why we have developed the mobile application Eduquality.  After an initial TechShare event, students can continue learning to code with their Raspberry Pi by watching engaging tutorials on Eduquality. The TechShare team will post short form video content onto Eduquality on a weekly basis teaching students how to build exciting projects, such as a retro video game console or a weather station. At Eduquality, the possibilities are truly limitless!
